# Day 11 - Rest Day

**Jan 25, 2026**

Took a break today to revisit some SQL basics before diving into window functions tomorrow.

## What I did

Went back and solved these three from Day 8:
- Rising Temperature (#197) - self-joins with dates make sense now
- Big Countries (#595) - just basic filtering, felt easy
- Delete Duplicate Emails (#196) - the self-join DELETE pattern is clearer

## Why I didn't do window functions today

Honestly, I rushed through #178, #184, and #185 yesterday and didn't really get them. The PARTITION BY stuff was confusing and I was just copying syntax without understanding.

Tomorrow I'm going to actually learn window functions properly instead of just grinding through problems.

## Current status

11 days straight of commits. SQL joins and GROUP BY are solid. Window functions... need work.

Tomorrow: Actually understanding RANK, DENSE_RANK, and PARTITION BY. No shortcuts.
