# Day 9: Jan 23, 2026

**Duration**: ~2 hours (real life interrupted)  
**Focus**: Sliding window mastery + self-join deep dive

## LeetCode DSA (Platform)
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)
  - Sliding window + set tracking
- Minimum Window Substring (Medium, revision)
  - Variable sliding window + counter optimization

## SQL Deep Dive (Self-study)
- Multiple self-join problems (unplanned deep dive)
  - Employee-manager relationships
  - Duplicate detection patterns
  - Date-based comparisons

## Notes
- Planned SQL window functions deferred to Day 10 (holiday)
- Real life > schedule (no guilt)
- Self-join mastery accelerating (strong Week 2 foundation)
- Tomorrow: Holiday push (SQL windows + catch-up)

**Status**: DSA momentum locked, SQL self-paced
