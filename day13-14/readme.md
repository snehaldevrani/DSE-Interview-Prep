# Days 13-14 (Jan 27-28)

Office course deadline approaching (28th). Spent both days on Python fundamentals course.

## What I covered

**Day 13:**
- Python basics: lists, dicts, tuples, sets
- String operations and manipulation
- Core syntax patterns

**Day 14:**
- Functions: regular, lambda, arguments
- Recursion basics
- Namespaces, scopes, closures
- Decorators
- Modules and packages, import pitfalls
- OOP: classes, class decorators
- Exceptions and magic methods

## Why this matters

Half of this directly helps with DSA (recursion, data structures) and interviews (OOP, decorators are common questions). Not wasted time.

Back to regular prep after course deadline (28th).
