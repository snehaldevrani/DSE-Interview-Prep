**Duration**: ~1 hour  
**Focus**: LeetCode Medium (Two-pointer & Hashing patterns)

## LeetCode (Platform)
- Container With Most Water (Medium)
  - Two-pointer approach
  - O(n) time, O(1) space
- Longest Consecutive Sequence (Medium)
  - Hash set based solution
  - O(n) time using membership checks

## Notes
- Focused on correctness and understanding, not speed
- Fixed boundary and operator-precedence bugs in two-pointer logic
- Skipped SQL today intentionally to avoid shallow copy-paste without revision
