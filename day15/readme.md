# Day 15

Jan 29, 2026

No self-study today. Just office work and rest.

## What I did

Office work - continued the Python fundamentals course:
- Namespaces and scopes
- Lambda functions 
- Function concepts and patterns

Needed the mental break after a rough few days. Sometimes rest is the right call.

Tomorrow: Getting back to SQL and prep work.
