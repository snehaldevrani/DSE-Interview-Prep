# Day 12

**Jan 26, 2026**

Office course took priority today (deadline 28th). Squeezed in window functions practice.

## What I learned

Window functions finally make sense. The key insight: PARTITION BY restarts the ranking for each group, but unlike GROUP BY, you keep all the rows.

## Problems solved

- #178 Rank Scores - basic DENSE_RANK()
- #184 Department Highest Salary - PARTITION BY clicked here
- #185 Top 3 Salaries - [took X minutes, struggled with Y, but got it]

## Notes

[Write whatever actually helped you understand - maybe a specific example, or when it clicked, or what you're still confused about]

Next: Finish office course by 28th, then back to regular prep schedule.
